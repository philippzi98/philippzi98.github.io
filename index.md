### Combating Online Misinformation at Scale: Developing Public Goods for Detecting and Testing Campaigns to Reduce Misinformation

Misinformation on social media platforms is rampant, from vaccine hesitancy to climate change. Policymakers and researchers regularly point to the lack of resources allocated by social media platforms to content moderation, especially in non-English languages and in the Global South, where independent fact-checking firms are also more rare. This creates a need to develop new public goods to detect misinformation on social media and to implement online interventions to reduce it. Jointly with colleagues at the World Bank, we are developing an ensemble approach to (1) identify false content, (2) identify propagators of false content, and (3) design interventions to combat the spread of misinformation.

**Claim Matching:** We identify social media posts that are semantically similar to fact-checked fake claims provided by organizations certified by the [International Fact-Checking Network](https://www.poynter.org/ifcn/).

**Topic Modeling:** As a diagnostic exercise we identify the topics amongst known fake claims via unsupervised topic modeling and analysis spatial and temporal deviances globally.
